# Rust Algorithms
This is me having fun implementing various algorithms and datastructures in
Rust.  Being idiomatic for the language is not particularly a goal--much of this
code could be satisfied by the standard library instead.

## Vector Algorithms (vector)
Algorithms operating on vectors.  Obviously, many could be further generalized
C++ iterator style to deal with more arbitrary collections.  I also haven't
bother templatizing most of the routines yet.

Sorts: quick, heap, merge, insertion, selection, bubble, bogo, shaker.

Searches: binary, jump

Selects: quick, naive

Misc: Fisher-Yates shuffle, Boyer-Moore Majority, Partition by Pivot, Max Heap,
Reverse, Is Sorted, Is Anagram
